      %p I have a passion for fixing things. I truly love it, from the very beginning when I realize something is broken, I get some kind of intrinsic excitement to fix it. I also happen to love helping people! There's nothing better than to fix or clarify and issue for someone and to see the happiness and gratitude in their eyes. Fixing things is so much fun, but seeing or hearing the reaction of those for whom I've fixed the issue is priceless.
